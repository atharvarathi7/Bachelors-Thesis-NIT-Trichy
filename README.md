Co-adaptive Reinforcement Learning-based Attacker-Defender Model for Secured Smart Distribution System
Smart distribution systems are witnessing increased deployment due to improved grid efficiency and reliability. These systems rely heavily on accurate meter readings for real-time monitoring and control, but the growing dependence on communication networks makes them vulnerable to cyber-physical threats such as false data injection attacks (FDIAs). 
Moreover, the need for data-driven technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in various sectors has been rising for over a decade, specifically in the energy sector.
To address this challenge, this work proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for FDIA injection and detection. In the proposed approach, there is an agent that acts as an adversary, learning to simulate and discover stealthy FDIA strategies, while the other agent serves as a detector, tasked with detecting and localising these attacks. This continuous adversarial training enables the defender agent to adapt dynamically to new and previously unseen FDIA patterns.
Simulation results show that the RL-based defender provides a detection rate of 98.61% when compared to 85.45% with DL-based defender. The overall findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in building resilient smart distribution systems and highlight the importance of adaptive, data-driven defence strategies in securing modern power grids.
